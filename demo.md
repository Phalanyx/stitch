Ask me about your timeline, clips, or what to do next.
add about 30 seconds caitlyn clark's highlights to the end of the video
I couldn't add those highlights because they would have overlapped with existing clips at the end of your timeline. Please try clearing some space or moving the current clips so I can place the new footage without an overlap.
try again
I’ve attempted this again, but it keeps failing because there isn't enough empty space at the end of your timeline. Please move or remove the existing clips at the end so I can insert the new highlights without them overlapping.

Stitch is a web based video editing platform that uses AI to help you edit your videos. The biggest problem with modern video editing is that it is often very manual and time consuming. Stitch is designed to be a more efficient and automated video editing platform. 
Let's use stitch to create a basketball edit.

We'll start by uploading a video. Uploading the video automatically indexes the video with Twelve Labs and Marengo and creates a summary of the video using Pegasus. While the video is indexing, we can explore the features of Stitch with a pre-indexed video. 

Let's add this video of steph curry highlights to the timeline. We can use the stitch agent to create segmented clips of the video by query using TwelveLab's Marengo and their search API.

"However, the video does not have audio."

We can use Stitch to add audio to the video as a narration using Eleven Labs.

Now that the caitlin clark highlights are indexed, lets add them to our edit. 

ask agent to add best highlights from caitlin clark

"Let's add some sick transition between our clips."

Another common problem with video editing is that you often need to add a transition between two clips. We can use Stitch to add a transition between two clips.

"Yo josh what if the agent makes some stupid changes that I dont like."

After each conversation, a monitoring subagent learns the user's behaviours by tracking their tool usage, validating against the agent changes to derive user likes and dislikes. The agent also analyzes user language to infer intent and preferences, logging sentiment and phrasing patterns for the analyze tool to update likes/dislikes. In‑context learning is applied within the current session by summarizing recent feedback and preferences and injecting it into the agent as a system prompt, allowing immediate adaptation to user behaviors.

Let's add a transition between the two clips to make the video more seamless using VEO 3.
