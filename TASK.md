# Tasks

- Define project-specific user behavioral states for the editor (e.g., uploading, building timeline, trimming, previewing, exporting), and the event/property schema that captures them.
- Implement tracking that records those behavioral states and key transitions as a linear sequence suitable for agent ingestion.
- Specify how the agent consumes the linearized state to deliver actions/insights beyond a simple rules engine.
