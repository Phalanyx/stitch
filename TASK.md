# Tasks

- Add a scrubber/progress tick bar to the preview player that shows the current playback time and allows seeking.
- Ensure the scrubber updates as the video plays and stays in sync when changing clips.
- Adjust the layout so the play button is not covered by the timeline (fix stacking/spacing/positioning).
- Verify on desktop and mobile that the timeline no longer overlaps the play controls.
